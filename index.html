          <h3>Strategy</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Space combat revolves around advanced tactics, such as feints, evasive maneuvers, and countermeasures. Pilots must combine skill and technology to outmaneuver their opponents.</p>
        <p>In the chaotic environment of space, combat strategies vary depending on the engagement type—whether a large-scale battle or a smaller skirmish. Key strategies include:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Dogfighting:</span> In close quarters, fighters engage in high-speed, evasive maneuvers, using energy shields and homing missiles. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">Ambushes:</span> Stealth-based operations in which a smaller force lures a larger fleet into a vulnerable position before attacking.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Fleet Battles:</span> Large-scale engagements where multiple ships from opposing factions engage each other with coordinated tactics. They often involve the use of tactics like flanking, decoy operations, and coordinated ship formations. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">Skirmishes:</span> Smaller battles, often involving a few ships or even individual ships, which are fast-paced and focused on surprise and agility.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Defensive Engagements:</span> When a fleet is tasked with defending a position or resource, often involving heavy fortifications and prolonged resistance.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
          <code>
              // Fleet Command Engagement Protocol<br>
              1. All ships report status at the start of the engagement.<br>
              2. Assign each ship a specific role: Assault, Defense, Recon, or Support.<br>
              3. Maintain communication between fleet ships to adjust tactics as needed.<br>
              4. Coordinate attack waves based on enemy fleet movements.<br>
